## Conclusion

Maintaining technological currency across the full stack requires a combination of automated tools, process integration, and organizational focus. The recommended solutions provide a balanced approach to detecting outdated or deprecated technologies while offering clear remediation pathways.

The highest ROI will be achieved by focusing first on high-risk areas (security vulnerabilities, EOL components) before expanding to comprehensive coverage. For most organizations, a phased implementation approach allows for gradual adoption and refinement of processes while delivering immediate value in critical areas.

Regular assessment of the technological currency posture (quarterly recommended) will help measure progress and adapt strategies as the technology landscape evolves.
